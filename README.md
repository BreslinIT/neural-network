# neural-network
This is a neural network that I made with the help of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK9AbJ4P8ao. The original video is from David Miller. I started with the basics from the video and expanded upon them.

## things I have done:
- created training/test data input and output
- implemented saving and loading network weights
- added some stuff for looking at the network in depth
- some python scripting for generating training data and targets
- find a way to visually represent the network

## things I want to do:
- improve overall documentation
- create muliple activation functions
- batch size
- make an easier interface for choosing constants such as learning rate
- create a gui for training and testing
- add an animation to the network visualizer
